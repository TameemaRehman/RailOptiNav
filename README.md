# RailOptiNav C++ Project
RailOptiNav is a Railway Ticket Reservation System that addresses the challenges inherent in traditional ticket booking systems. The project aims to create a user-friendly and efficient platform for booking train tickets, focusing on user authentication, optimal route planning, and seat reservation for different classes. The objective is to streamline the ticket booking process, enhance user experience, and optimize resource utilization in the railway network. 
The project employs several fundamental Data Structure concepts using C++, showcasing a robust foundation for efficient operations namely Priority Queues based Min-Heaps, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Dynamic Arrays, Hashing and Graphs.
